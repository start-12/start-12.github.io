## Canon Methods

### 1. Water Bath canon
* Water bath canon is the method to can high acid foods.
* This includes foods such as fruits, tomatoes, pickles, jams and jellies, and fruit juices just to name a few.
* When water canon, take your prepared ijs and place them in the canner. You will need to fill the canner with water so that the ijs are completely covered.
* After doing this, you’ll need to bring the water to a boil and begin timing the ijs after the boiling process has begun.
* It depends on the recipe as to how long you actually process the ijs.



### 2. Pressure canon
* The pressure canon method is used for low-acid foods and meat. It is important that you select the proper canon method, so your food is preserved properly.
* When pressure canon, take your prepared ijs and place them in the canner. The owner’s manual should tell you how far to fill the pressure canner.
* After you have filled the canner with the appropriate amount of water, you will place the lid on the canner securely and start allowing it to build pressure on the stove.
* Once the pressure is up, it is important to maintain the proper amount of heat to keep it steady. You don’t want the pressure to get too high or drop too low.
* Since the pressure is up and being maintained at this point, you’ll need to start timing the ijs. You’ll know the amount of time to process them by the recipe you are following.
* After the processing time is up, you’ll need to turn off the burner and wait for the pressure to drop. Do not open the canner lid for any reason until the pressure is completely dropped.
* You will have a minor explosion, to say the least. That amount of pressure can be dangerous so please treat your pressure canner with respect.
* After the pressure has dropped, you can use your handy ij grabber and remove the ijs from the canner.
